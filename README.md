This project is a Tkinter-based desktop application designed to assist the Argentina football team's coach by providing an interactive interface for retrieving player and team statistics. The UI allows users to select various insights, such as ordering players by age, goals, and man-of-the-match awards, as well as determining the best player, best goal scorer, and best goalkeeper. Additionally, match details can be filtered to show all matches, won matches, or lost matches. The system also provides average team statistics, including goals, assists, possession, and shots on target. The user interacts with dropdown menus and buttons, and the retrieved data is displayed within the application. This tool simplifies team analysis and helps in making informed decisions.
